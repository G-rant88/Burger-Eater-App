<h1>Welcome to Burger Eater 3000</h1>

<p>the deployed app is <a href="https://burger-eater3000.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
<p>Version 2 Of The App is <a href="https://burgerapp-version2.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">HERE</p>
	
<p>All the data is tied to my mysql db.</p>

<p>After adding a new burger it will appear on the left side list with a "DEVOUR IT" button next to it.</p>

<p>Once devoured it will go to the right side.</p>

<p>Devouring updates the db to set the devoured property to true.</p>

<p>Adding a burger inserts a new burger into the db.</p>

<p>Regurgitating sets the devoured to false and puts it on the left side.</p>

<p>Going to bathroom deletes from the mysql table where devoured is true.</p>

<p>the burgers are ordered by their id in the db.</p>

<p>Have fun eating those burgs!</p>
